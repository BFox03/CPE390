# Computer Design

    Clock 
        Master Timer, keeps everything going on at the same time on CPU
        Cannot reach too high clock speeds because it would use too much power and reach too high of heat\
    TDP
        Thermal Design Power 
        Today: server TDP = 250 Watts (very hot)
        All chips contain temp sensor, if too hot they shut down
        cool with fans(air), heat sinks, thermal paste, silver
            why dont we use silver(best heat and conductor) cuz it tarnish/rusts
            use gold which is more expensive but does not tarnish
    Caches
        32-bit = 4Gb address space
        64-bit = 4.2 * 4.2B = 18 quintillion bytes
            too much ram Intel CPU does not address 64-bit 48 pins 
    ALU
        Arithmetic Logic Unit (does all the math)
        add, sub, mul, div, mod?, and, or, xor, not
    CISC
        Complex Instruction Set Computer (Intel)
    RISC
        Reduced Instruction Set Computer (ARM)

# Truth Tables
          AB       A+B      Ao+B
A   B   A and B   A or B   A xor B   A nand B   A nor B
0   0   0         0        0         1          1
0   1   0         1        1         1          0
1   0   0         1        1         1          0
1   1   1         1        0         0          0

N channel mosfets are mor efficient than P-channel
it is more efficient with current technology to implement NAND and nor

SSD Solid State Drive, built out of NAND flash
